# Sitting Cube 
An iterative prototype in the context of my master thesis "Exploration von interaktiven und unaufdringlichen Interfaces in einer semi-public Meetup Situation" (en. "Exploration of interactive and unobtrusive interfaces in a semi-public meetup situation") WS19/30 got created.
The prototype consists of an cube, made out of plastic and containing LEDs, which serves as a stool. Users can change the color of it using an ipad which, is showing a web interface hosted by an ESP8266.
